        <p>Thomas John Watson Sr. (February 17, 1874 to June 19, 1956)
            was an American businessman who served as the chairman and CEO of IBM.
            He oversaw the company's growth into an international force from 1914
            to 1956. Watson developed IBM's management style and corporate culture
            from John Henry Patterson's training at NCR . He turned the company 
            into a highly effective selling organization, based largely on punched 
            card tabulating machines. A leading self-made industrialist, he was
            one of the richest men of his time and was called the world's greatest
            salesman when he died in 1956.
